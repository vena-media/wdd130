        <p>Hi I am Ediomo, a brand designer who helps founders and creatives turn ideas into visuals that feel
            intentional and alive. I specialize in minimal, story-driven logos, and I have helped brands craft
            identities that looks just as good as their work. Why I am qualified: I have worked with founders and small
            businesses to create brand identities that balance elegance, clarity, and personality. My designs are
            strategic, intentional, and designed to stand out in both digital and physical contexts.
