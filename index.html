            <p>Hi I am Ediomo, a brand designer who helps founders and creatives turn ideas into visuals that feel
                intentional and alive.
                I specialize in minimal, story-driven logos, and I have helped brands craft identities
                that looks just as good as their work. Why I am qualified: I have worked with founders and
                small
                businesses to create brand identities that balance elegance, clarity, and personality. My designs are
                strategic, intentional, and designed to stand out in both digital and physical contexts.
            </p>

            <img src="week02/images/lagos-nigeria.jpg" alt="Lagos Nigeria">
            <p>Lagos is a coastal city in southwestern Nigeria and the countrys economic powerhouse. It is bordered by
                the
                Atlantic Ocean to the south and surrounded by Ogun State to the north and east. Known for its fast-paced
                lifestyle,
                diverse culture, and thriving tech and creative industries, Lagos is one of Africas largest and busiest
                cities.
                Victoria Island and Ikoyi serve as major financial hubs, while the citys markets, beaches, and nightlife
                make it a center of
                entertainment and tourism.</p>
